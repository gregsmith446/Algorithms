Simple ASP.NET Console Application written in C#.

The program takes as input a person's age.

The function "public void amIOld()" then determines whether the person
is young, a teenager, or old and writes the result to the console.

The other function "public void yearPasses()" sole purpose is to increment the given age by 1 year.

After the person's age is given, the result is given for that age, plus 3 other ages, the ones incremented by yearPasses().

Give it a try!!
